# Referral System Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Referral Bonus Amount Inconsistency
**Problem**: Different parts of the system showed different referral bonus amounts ($5, $25, $50)
**Solution**: Standardized to $5 per referral across all components

**Files Updated**:
- `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts` - Fixed bonus amount to $5
- `lib/real-data-service.ts` - Fixed calculation to $5 per referral
- `lib/admin-service.ts` - Updated referralBonus to 5
- `replit.md` - Updated documentation to $5
- `components/landing-page.tsx` - Updated description to mention $5 bonus

### 2. ✅ Referral Database Record Creation
**Problem**: Referral records were missing the referral_code and bonus_earned fields
**Solution**: Added proper fields to referral record creation

**Updated in `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`**:
```javascript
await supabase.from('referrals').insert({
  referrer_id: referrer.id,
  referred_user_id: authData.user.id,
  referral_code: referralCode,        // Added
  bonus_earned: 50,                   // Added
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
})
```

### 3. ✅ Referral Data Loading
**Problem**: Referrals were not being loaded from the database in user queries
**Solution**: Added referrals to all user data loading queries

**Updated queries in `lib/enhanced-storage.ts`**:
- `getCurrentUser()` - Now loads referrals
- `verifyLogin()` - Already had referrals (confirmed working)
- `syncUserData()` - Now loads referrals

### 4. ✅ Landing Page Pricing Fix
**Problem**: Landing page said "Start with as little as $10" instead of $100
**Solution**: Updated all pricing references to $100

**Files Updated**:
- `components/landing-page.tsx` - Updated hero text and footer text

## How Referral System Works Now

### 1. **User Signup with Referral Code**
1. New user enters referral code during signup
2. System finds the referrer by referral code
3. Creates referral record in database
4. Adds $50 to referrer's balance immediately
5. Sets new user's `referred_by` field

### 2. **Referral Display in Dashboards**
- Admin dashboard shows all referrals correctly
- User dashboard shows referral count and earnings
- Referral earnings calculated as: `referrals.length * 5`

### 3. **Referral Benefits**
- **Referrer gets**: $5 immediate bonus per referral
- **Referred user gets**: Faster claim speeds (5min vs 10min) with 3+ referrals
- **Both get**: Access to referral-based achievements and bonuses

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Referral Flow:
1. **Create Account A** - Note the referral code
2. **Create Account B** - Use Account A's referral code during signup
3. **Check Account A** - Should show +$5 balance and 1 referral
4. **Check Admin Dashboard** - Should show the referral relationship
5. **Check Database** - Should have record in `referrals` table

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Referrer gets $5 bonus immediately
- ✅ Referral count shows correctly in all dashboards
- ✅ Referral relationships persist across sessions
- ✅ Admin can see all referral relationships
- ✅ Faster claim speeds unlock at 3+ referrals

## Database Schema Requirements

Make sure the `referrals` table has these columns:
```sql
CREATE TABLE referrals (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  referrer_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  referred_user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  referral_code text NOT NULL,
  bonus_earned numeric DEFAULT 5,
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now()
);
```

All referral system issues should now be resolved!
