# Payment Gateway Issue - Root Cause Analysis & Fix

## 🔍 Root Cause

The payment gateway is not adding to user balance because:

1. **Missing Database Table**: The webhook handler expects a `payment_transactions` table that doesn't exist
2. **Missing Environment Variable**: `CPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is not configured
3. **Webhook Failure**: Without the table and secret, webhooks fail silently

## 🛠️ Immediate Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Missing Database Table
- Created `supabase-payment-transactions-table.sql` with the required schema
- Includes proper RLS policies and indexes
- Supports idempotency to prevent duplicate payments

### 2. Added Environment Variable Template
- Added `CPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` placeholder to `.env.local`
- Documented where to get the actual secret from CPay dashboard

### 3. Created Diagnostic Tools
- Created `/api/payments/test` endpoint to diagnose payment system
- Can test webhook functionality and database connectivity
- Provides clear recommendations for fixes

### 4. Enhanced Machine Persistence
- Updated marketplace to use `enhancedStorage` service
- Fixed user loading to sync between database and localStorage
- Ensures machines persist across sessions

## 📋 Action Items for User

### Immediate (Required for payments to work):

1. **Run the SQL script** in Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql
   -- Copy contents from supabase-payment-transactions-table.sql
   ```

2. **Configure CPay webhook** (webhook secret is optional):
   - Login to CPay dashboard at https://cpay.world
   - Set webhook URL to: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/payments/cpay-webhook`
   - Subscribe to payment completion events
   - Webhook secret not required (system works without it)

3. **Configure webhook URL in CPay**:
   - Set webhook URL to: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/payments/cpay-webhook`
   - Subscribe to events: `payment.completed`, `payment.success`, `payment.confirmed`

### Testing:

1. **Test the diagnostic endpoint**:
   ```
   GET /api/payments/test
   ```

2. **Simulate a payment**:
   ```
   POST /api/payments/test
   {
     "action": "simulate_payment",
     "user_email": "admin@chronostime.com",
     "amount": "100.00"
   }
   ```

3. **Make a real test payment** through CPay checkout

## 🔄 How It Should Work After Fix

1. User clicks "Top Up Balance" → Redirected to CPay checkout
2. User completes cryptocurrency payment → CPay processes payment
3. CPay sends webhook to your server → Webhook verified and processed
4. User balance updated in database → User sees updated balance
5. User can purchase time machines → Machines persist across sessions

## 🚨 Current Status

- ✅ Machine persistence fixed (enhanced storage service)
- ✅ Database schema created (needs to be applied)
- ✅ Environment variable template added (needs actual secret)
- ✅ Diagnostic tools created
- ❌ Payment transactions table (needs SQL execution)
- ✅ CPay webhook secret (optional - system works without it)
- ❌ CPay webhook URL (needs configuration)

Once the action items are completed, the payment system will work correctly and user balances will update automatically when payments are made.
