## 🔧 Setup Required

### **Update CPay Callback URL**:
The callback URL remains the same, but now it returns HTML pages for iframe:

- **New behavior**: Returns success/error HTML pages that communicate with parent window

### **Iframe Source**:
Updated to use your custom domain:
- **New URL**: `https://checkouts.chronostime.fund/checkout/acb26bab-0d68-4ffa-b9f9-5ad577762fc7`
- **Embedded in**: Modal iframe on your website

## 🧪 Testing the New System

### **Test Steps**:
1. **Go to Balance Topup** page
2. **Click "Buy with Crypto"** → Modal should open with payment form
3. **Complete a test payment** → Should see success message in modal
4. **Check balance update** → Should reflect new amount immediately
5. **Modal should auto-close** → Returns to dashboard

### **Expected Results**:
- ✅ Modal opens smoothly with embedded payment form
- ✅ Payment completes without leaving your website
- ✅ Success message appears in modal
- ✅ Balance updates automatically
- ✅ Modal closes and user sees updated dashboard
