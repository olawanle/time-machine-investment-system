# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing critical errors, disconnected workflows, and architectural issues identified in the ChronosTime investment platform codebase. The system currently has several technical debt issues, missing components, inconsistent data flows, and potential runtime errors that need to be addressed to ensure stability and maintainability.

## Glossary

- **ChronosTime Platform**: The main investment platform application built with Next.js and React
- **Time Machine**: Investment portfolio entities that generate rewards for users
- **Supabase Storage**: The primary database storage system using PostgreSQL
- **Local Storage Backup**: Fallback storage mechanism using browser localStorage
- **API Dashboard**: The main user interface component for managing investments
- **Component Dependencies**: React components that depend on other components or utilities
- **Data Flow**: The movement of data between components, storage, and user interfaces
- **Error Boundaries**: React components that catch and handle JavaScript errors
- **Type Safety**: Ensuring TypeScript types are consistent across the application

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all component imports to resolve correctly, so that the application builds without errors and users can access all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL resolve all component imports without errors
2. WHEN a component is imported, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL verify the component exists at the specified path
3. WHEN missing components are identified, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL either create the missing components or remove invalid imports
4. WHEN component dependencies are checked, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL ensure all UI components have consistent interfaces
5. WHERE optional components are referenced, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL provide fallback implementations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent data flow between storage systems, so that my investment data is always accurate and synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is saved, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL ensure data consistency between Supabase and localStorage backup
2. WHEN storage operations fail, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL gracefully fallback to alternative storage methods
3. WHEN data is retrieved, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL validate data integrity before displaying to users
4. WHEN multiple storage systems are used, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL maintain data synchronization
5. IF storage connection fails, THEN THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL display appropriate error messages to users

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I can continue using the platform even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript errors occur, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL catch errors using Error Boundaries
2. WHEN API calls fail, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN components fail to load, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL show loading states or fallback content
4. WHEN network connectivity issues occur, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL provide offline functionality where possible
5. WHERE critical errors happen, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL log errors for debugging while maintaining user experience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent TypeScript types across all components, so that the codebase is maintainable and type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL use consistent TypeScript interfaces
2. WHEN data is passed between components, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL validate type compatibility
3. WHEN storage operations occur, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL ensure type safety for all data models
4. WHEN API responses are processed, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL validate response types
5. WHERE type mismatches exist, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL resolve inconsistencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all features to work seamlessly together, so that I can manage my investments without encountering broken workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between sections, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL maintain user state and context
2. WHEN performing investment operations, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL update all related UI components
3. WHEN claiming rewards, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL synchronize machine states and user balances
4. WHEN using referral features, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL properly track and reward referral activities
5. WHERE workflow dependencies exist, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL ensure proper execution order

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean separation of concerns between components, so that the codebase is modular and easy to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are organized, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL separate UI components from business logic
2. WHEN utilities are created, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL provide reusable functions for common operations
3. WHEN storage operations are performed, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL use consistent storage interfaces
4. WHEN styling is applied, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL use consistent design system patterns
5. WHERE code duplication exists, THE ChronosTime Platform SHALL refactor into reusable components or utilities
