# ChronosTime Investment Platform

## Overview
ChronosTime is a professional investment platform enabling users to invest in virtual "time machines" that generate passive income through weekly returns. The platform supports cryptocurrency payments, includes gamification elements, and provides a comprehensive admin dashboard for management. Its core purpose is to offer a unique, engaging investment experience with a focus on a **mandatory dark theme** with premium neon accents. The business vision is to capture a significant market share in the alternative investment space by combining innovative investment products with a compelling user experience.

   - Integrated SupremeAdminDashboard into APIDashboard

## User Preferences

- Support contact: **support@chronostime.fund**
- Referral bonus: **$5 per referral**

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a premium **dark-neon aesthetic** with a color palette including Electric Cyan (#3CE7FF), Indigo (#6C63FF), and Gold (#EFBF60), set against Deep Space backgrounds (#020817, #0b1220). It utilizes a Glass-Morphism effect for cards and other UI elements to enhance the dark theme. The design is responsive, supporting mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports. 

**Theme System:**
- Default theme: **DARK ONLY** (forced in `:root` CSS variables)
- No light theme option - dark theme is enforced platform-wide
- Admin theme: Unique purple/aurora gradient distinct from user dashboard
- All forms, cards, and pages use dark backgrounds

### Technical Implementations
The frontend is built with Next.js 15 (App Router) and React 19, leveraging server-side rendering and client-side hydration. It uses a component-based architecture with TypeScript for type safety. UI components are built on Radix UI primitives and shadcn/ui, styled with Tailwind CSS. State management is handled primarily with local React state. The backend uses Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security, custom authentication, and server-side API routes for sensitive operations.

### Feature Specifications
Key features include an authentication system, a dashboard with investment overviews, a time machine marketplace, a referral system ($5 bonus per referral), analytics, an admin panel for platform management, and gamification elements like a daily spin wheel and leaderboards. A critical feature is the integration of cryptocurrency payments via CPay (checkout ID: acb26bab-0d68-4ffa-b9f9-5ad577762fc7), including a secure webhook implementation for automatic balance updates and idempotency.

### System Design Choices
The system prioritizes security with server-side authentication, RLS, and environment variable management for sensitive credentials. Data storage is primarily handled by Supabase PostgreSQL, with a schema designed for users, time machines, referrals, withdrawals, and payment transactions. A custom storage service abstracts database operations, ensuring type safety and asynchronous interactions. The system is designed for high availability and performance, with connection pooling via PgBouncer.
